## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT PHASE: Voting System**

### **Phase 2 Goals**: Enable democratic decision-making with transparent, auditable voting

#### **Ready to Implement** (Planned in `PHASE2_VOTING_PLAN.md`):
- **Vote Casting**: for/against/abstain on open proposals
- **Quorum Rules**: Configurable minimum participation thresholds
- **Real-time Tallies**: Live vote counts and outcome prediction  
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable vote history for transparency
- **Auto-closure**: Proposals automatically close when quorum reached

#### **Technical Approach**: 
- Extend existing `proposals` domain (proven pattern)
- Add `votes`, `vote_events`, `quorum_rules` tables
- Implement configurable democratic rules
- Maintain complete audit trail for accountability

#### **API Extensions**:
```
POST /api/proposals/{id}/votes     - Cast or update vote
GET  /api/proposals/{id}/votes     - List all votes  
GET  /api/proposals/{id}/tally     - Get current tally and outcome
POST /api/proposals/{id}/finalize  - Admin: finalize outcome
```

## 🚧 **REMAINING MVP PHASES (Prioritized)**

### **Phase 3: Authentication System** 🔐
- **Goal**: Replace dev `member_id` parameters with production authentication
- **Approach**: WebAuthn passwordless + email magic links
- **Impact**: Secure member sessions, role-based permissions
- **Integration**: All existing APIs will use authenticated member context

### **Phase 4: Frontend Migration** ⚡
- **Goal**: Transform basic Svelte to production SvelteKit PWA  
- **Approach**: Server-side rendering, offline-first architecture
- **Features**: Progressive Web App, IndexedDB caching, mobile-first design
- **Integration**: Wire all backend APIs with accessible cooperative UX

### **Phase 5: Offline Support** 📱
- **Goal**: Offline-first architecture for reliable cooperative access
- **Approach**: Read cache + queued mutations + sync journal
- **Features**: Work without internet, sync when reconnected
- **Impact**: Reliable access for cooperatives with varying connectivity
