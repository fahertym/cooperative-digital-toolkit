# ðŸ¤– AI-Generated Documentation

This directory contains documentation automatically generated by AI coding assistants to track project progress, implementation plans, and development status for the Cooperative Digital Toolkit.

## ðŸ“‹ **Current Documents**

### **Implementation Status & Progress**
- **[`PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`](./PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md)** - Current achievement status, metrics, and completion tracking
- **[`CODING_AGENT_PROMPT.md`](./CODING_AGENT_PROMPT.md)** - Complete project context for AI development sessions

### **Implementation Plans & Roadmaps**  
- **[`NEXT_STEPS_PLAN.md`](./NEXT_STEPS_PLAN.md)** - Comprehensive roadmap for all upcoming phases
- **[`PHASE2_VOTING_PLAN.md`](./PHASE2_VOTING_PLAN.md)** - Detailed voting system implementation architecture

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose & Usage**

### **For AI Coding Assistants**
These documents provide complete project context, established patterns, and clear next steps for continued development across coding sessions.

### **For Human Developers**  
Reference materials for understanding project status, implementation decisions, and planned architecture.

### **For Project Management**
Progress tracking, completion metrics, and timeline planning for cooperative stakeholders.

## ðŸ”„ **Maintenance**

These documents are **automatically updated** by AI assistants as implementation progresses:
- Status summaries reflect current completion state
- Plans are refined based on implementation learnings  
- New phase documents are added as needed

## ðŸ“– **Integration with Main Documentation**

AI-generated docs complement the main project documentation in `/docs/`:
- **Technical specs** remain in main docs (API specs, data models, architecture)
- **Progress tracking** and **implementation planning** live here
- **Established patterns** and **next steps** are documented here for AI continuity
