# Cooperative Principles & Evaluation Rubric

## Principles
- **Democratic control:** encode transparency and auditability.
- **Member benefit first:** optimize for adoption within 30 days.
- **FOSS & portability:** permissive licensing; easy export; avoid lock-in.
- **Accessibility:** low bandwidth, offline-first, a11y-aware UI.
- **Sustainability:** small runtime footprint; green ops.

## Decision Rubric (score 1â€“5)
- TCO (infra + training)  
- Openness (license, docs, exports)  
- Complexity (setup, learning)  
- Alignment (co-op values)  
- Performance/Resilience (offline, error handling)  

Tools/features below threshold get redesigned or deferred.
