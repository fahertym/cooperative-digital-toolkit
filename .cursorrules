You are assisting with an open-source Cooperative Digital Toolkit.

Non-negotiables:
- Encode cooperative values: transparency, democratic control, low TCO.
- Prefer Go + Svelte + PostgreSQL; offline-first UX.
- Modular monolith first, microservices only when metrics demand.

Style:
- Small, composable modules with clear interfaces.
- Tests first; public APIs documented in /docs.
- Avoid vendor lock-in; permissive licenses.

Cursor Tasks:
- When generating code, update docs in /docs accordingly.
- Keep issue titles in Conventional Commits style.
